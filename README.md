Content:

## Regression

1. Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb
  *
2. Vectorization.ipynb
  * Demonstrate common uses of vectors and matrices in Python, as typically applied in machine learning implementations.
3. Model_Representation.ipynb
  * Implement the model  ùëìùë§,ùëè for linear regression with one variable
  * Experiment with different w and b
5. Feature scaling and learning rate.ipynb
  * run Gradient Descent on a data set with multiple features
  * explore the impact of the learning rate alpha on gradient descent
  * improve performance of gradient descent by feature scaling using z-score normalization

## Classification

1. Classification_Basics.ipynb
  * contrast regression and classification
  * explore the sigmoid function (also known as the logistic function)
  * explore logistic regression; which uses the sigmoid function
  * Plot the decision boundary for a logistic regression model
2. Logistic Regression-Logistic Loss.ipynb
  * explore the reason the squared error loss is not appropriate for logistic regression
  * explore the logistic loss function
3. Cost Function for Logistic Regression.ipynb
  * examine the implementation and utilize the cost function for logistic regression
4. Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression.ipynb
  * update gradient descent for logistic regression
  * explore gradient descent on a familiar data set
5. Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn.ipynb
  * Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
